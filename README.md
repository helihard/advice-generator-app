## Overview

This is the first Frontend Mentor Challenge that I've built only with React (have been working with converting some of my vanilla JavaScript solutions to React previously). The task felt daunting at first since I have just recently started learning React, but it turned out to be easier than expected once I had divided the project in components, and ran it on local server parallel to coding in VS Code for live feedback.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Generate a new piece of advice by clicking the dice icon

### Screenshot

In repo (folder "screenshots").

## My process

- setting up React app
- basic layout and structure with components and folder
- basic styling
- button styling with hover state
- adding fetch + button functionality
- responsive layout for mobile vs desktop
- minor adjustments

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Fetch API

### What I learned

Getting more comfortable using React and building in React only without making a detour into vanilla JS first, getting to knowing how to use Fetch API in general and in React in particular.

### Continued development

Continuing along the route outlined above

### Useful resources

Various resources on how to make API requests in React, mainly
